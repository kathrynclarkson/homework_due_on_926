		/* In the style of Colossal Cave Adventure, write a three-room adventure game. The user should start in one room: “You are in a room. There is an exit to the north and to the west”. Try using the prompt text for output (prompt ("you are in a room...")) The user will type an instruction into the prompt (e.g. “go north”). Figure out what the user wants to do (“go north” or “go west”) and follow that instruction. Put a dragon in the north room and a shield in the west room. They must get the shield (“get shield” in the west room) to get past the dragon. The west room has an exit to the east (the starting room) and the north room has an exit to the north and south (the win condition and the starting room). When they get past the dragon (“go north” in the north room while holding the shield), they win the game.If you are feeling adventurous, try adding even more rooms, items, and challenges to this game! */
